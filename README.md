## 🧠 Problem Statement
The banking sector leverages customer behavior data to customize services and improve marketing strategies. In this project, the goal is to predict credit card spending behavior of customers based on their past transactions and demographic data.

## 📂 Data Overview
The data consists of three datasets:

CustomerDemographics.csv: Personal and demographic information like gender, age, income, tenure, region, etc.

CustomerBehaviorData.csv: Past credit/debit card usage, loan status, transaction details, and investment behavior.

CreditConsumptionData.csv: Target variable cc_cons for training (some missing, needs to be predicted for others).

## 🎯 Objective
Predict the average credit card consumption for the next three months (cc_cons) using:

Demographic and behavioral variables.

Handle missing target values.

Use RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error) as the evaluation metric.

## 🛠️ Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Missing Value Imputation

Feature Engineering

Train-test split with cross-validation

Tried models like:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest

XGBoost

Model Evaluation using RMSPE

Final predictions on missing cc_cons
